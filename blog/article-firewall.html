        Perimeter defenses are essential — but phishing bypasses them entirely.
        Here's why, and what actually reduces the risk for SMEs.

      <p>
        Many small and medium-sized businesses invest in firewalls expecting them
        to block most cyber threats. While firewalls are important, phishing attacks
        routinely bypass them — and that gap is where most real-world breaches begin.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Firewalls Were Never Designed to Stop Phishing</h2>

      <p>
        Firewalls control network traffic based on rules: IPs, ports, protocols,
        and sometimes application behaviour. Phishing attacks don't exploit network
        weaknesses — they exploit <strong>human trust</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When an employee clicks a malicious email link or opens a fake invoice,
        the traffic often looks completely legitimate to a firewall. The request
        goes out to an HTTPS site, the response comes back — the firewall sees
        nothing wrong.
      </p>

      <h2>How Phishing Bypasses Traditional Security</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Emails arrive through trusted mail providers (Microsoft, Google)</li>
        <li>Links use HTTPS and valid SSL certificates</li>
        <li>Malware or credential theft happens after the user interacts</li>
        <li>Cloud-hosted phishing pages avoid IP and domain reputation blocks</li>
        <li>Attackers rotate infrastructure faster than blocklists update</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In short: the firewall sees normal traffic — the damage happens after the click.
      </p>

      <h2>What Actually Reduces Phishing Risk for SMEs</h2>

      <p>
        Instead of relying solely on perimeter defences, SMEs should focus on
        layered, realistic controls that assume some phishing will get through.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email security gateway</strong> with phishing and attachment scanning</li>
        <li><strong>User awareness training</strong> — realistic simulations, not just videos</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong> on all accounts</li>
        <li><strong>Conditional access policies</strong> to flag unusual sign-in behaviour</li>
        <li><strong>Clear incident response steps</strong> so staff know what to do after a click</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The goal isn't to stop every phishing email — it's to reduce the blast radius
        when phishing succeeds. Because it will, eventually.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Phishing is not a firewall problem.
        It's a visibility, identity, and response problem.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        Firewalls still matter — but they are not phishing protection.
        SMEs that understand this early avoid false confidence and
        build layered defences that actually hold up during real incidents.
        Start with email security and MFA before adding anything else.
