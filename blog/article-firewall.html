    <p>
      Many small and medium-sized businesses invest in firewalls expecting them
      to block most cyber threats. While firewalls are important, phishing attacks
      routinely bypass them — and that gap is where most real-world breaches begin.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Firewalls Were Never Designed to Stop Phishing</h2>

    <p>
      Firewalls control network traffic based on rules: IPs, ports, protocols,
      and sometimes application behavior. Phishing attacks don’t exploit network
      weaknesses — they exploit <strong>human trust</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When an employee clicks a malicious email link or opens a fake invoice,
      the traffic often looks completely legitimate to a firewall.
    </p>

    <h2>How Phishing Bypasses Traditional Security</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Emails arrive through trusted mail providers</li>
      <li>Links use HTTPS and valid certificates</li>
      <li>Malware is delivered after user interaction</li>
      <li>Cloud-based phishing pages avoid IP reputation checks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In short: the firewall sees normal traffic — the damage happens after.
    </p>

    <h2>What Actually Reduces Phishing Risk for SMEs</h2>

    <p>
      Instead of relying solely on perimeter defenses, SMEs should focus on
      layered, realistic controls.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Email security with phishing detection</li>
      <li>User awareness and realistic training</li>
      <li>Strong identity controls and MFA</li>
      <li>Monitoring abnormal sign-in behavior</li>
      <li>Clear incident response steps</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The goal isn’t perfection — it’s reducing blast radius when phishing succeeds.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Phishing is not a firewall problem.
      It’s a visibility, identity, and response problem.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
      Firewalls still matter — but they are not phishing protection.
      SMEs that understand this early avoid false confidence and
      build defenses that actually hold up during real incidents.

      If phishing is a concern, start with clarity —
      not tools or panic buying.
