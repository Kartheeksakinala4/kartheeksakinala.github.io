      <p>
        Whether you've accidentally formatted a camera's SD card or deliberately
        wiped one before selling a device, a common assumption is that the data
        is gone. In most cases, that assumption is wrong — at least for now.
      </p>

      <h2>Quick Format vs Full Format</h2>

      <p>
        When you format an SD card in a camera or on a computer, two very different
        things can happen depending on the method chosen:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Quick format</strong> — only the file system index is reset.
          The actual file data remains on the card until overwritten by new photos
          or files. This is the most common format used in cameras.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Full format</strong> — writes zeros or random data across the
          entire card, making data recovery significantly harder or impossible
          depending on card type.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The vast majority of "accidental formats" in cameras are quick formats.
        That's why professional data recovery software can still read the
        underlying data structures and reconstruct files.
      </p>

      <h2>What Cameras Actually Do</h2>

      <p>
        Most DSLR and mirrorless cameras — Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm — perform a
        quick format by default. Some models offer a "low-level format" option that
        is more thorough, but users rarely use it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The camera's firmware resets the FAT32 or exFAT partition table, marking
        all clusters as free space. The raw image data (JPG, RAW, video) remains
        physically intact on the NAND flash until the camera writes new images
        over those sectors.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Recovery Works — and When It Fails</h2>

      <p>
        Recovery is possible when the underlying data hasn't been overwritten.
        The window for successful recovery narrows every time the card is used
        after formatting. Key factors that affect success:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>How much was shot after the format</strong> — every new photo risks overwriting old data</li>
        <li><strong>Card capacity</strong> — larger cards give more breathing room</li>
        <li><strong>File system type</strong> — FAT32 is easier to recover than exFAT in some scenarios</li>
        <li><strong>Card wear</strong> — heavily used cards with worn cells recover less reliably</li>
        <li><strong>TRIM on modern cards</strong> — some newer UHS-II and CFexpress cards perform background erase operations that can destroy recoverable data faster</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Shift Towards Harder-to-Recover Storage</h2>

      <p>
        Older SD cards used simple NAND flash with straightforward data layouts.
        Newer high-speed cards — CFexpress Type A, Type B, and UHS-II SD — use
        more complex controller firmware that may aggressively manage free space.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some controllers implement background garbage collection that erases
        "deleted" data blocks even when the card is idle. This means that a card
        left sitting in a drawer after a format may have less recoverable data
        a week later than it did immediately after the format.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Stop using the card immediately after a suspected accidental format.
        Every write reduces your chances of a full recovery.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>What To Do If You've Formatted a Card Accidentally</h2>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Stop using the card straight away</strong> — don't shoot more photos</li>
        <li><strong>Remove it from the camera</strong> and store it safely</li>
        <li><strong>Do not reformat it again</strong> — some people do this thinking it helps</li>
        <li><strong>Try recovery software</strong> on a copy of the card if you're technical</li>
        <li><strong>Contact a professional</strong> for critical files — especially if the card was used after formatting</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        A formatted SD card is not a lost cause — but acting quickly is critical.
        As storage technology evolves, the window for recovery is shrinking,
        especially on professional-grade cards. If the files matter, treat it
        like an emergency and avoid touching the card until you have professional advice.
